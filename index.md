**Bio**

I'm an undergraduate attending UCI for a computer science and computer game science degree. I like art and media: whether it be visual art, movies, or music. I love EDM, my tastes do vary from Liquid Drum and Bass (_Hybrid Minds_), to House (_Shingo Nakamura_), and even Chiptune (_Dubmood_). 

I also like to draw a lot, specifically landscapes and inanimate objects, but I'm somewhat averse to coloring because I mostly doodle nowadays. I'll upload my artwork on here eventually.  

My favorite form of media is games, they have been a big part of my life and I have many fond memories within games. I suppose my interest in games is what led to my interest in computers and softwares.
