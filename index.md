### My bio

I'm an undergraduate attending UCI for a computer game science degree. I like art and media: whether it be visual art, movies, or music. I love EDM, my tastes do vary from Liquid Drum and Bass (_Hybrid Minds_), to House (_Shingo Nakamura_), and even Chiptune (_Dubmood_). I do ocasionally listen to music outside of my favorite genre. My favorite form of media is games, they have been a big part of my life and I have many fond memories within games. I decided to become a computer game science major so that I would be a part of the industry that helped moulded me and shaped me into who I am today. I like to draw a lot, specifically landscapes and inanimate objects, but I'm somewhat averse to coloring because I mostly doodle nowadays.
